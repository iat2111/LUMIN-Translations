			<p>Syllabi are circulating documents, physically printed or digitally shared, that communicate information and knowledge related to a particular subject or course of study or teaching. Syllabi are thus hinged to education and forms of higher education more specifically, and their currency usually comes from prestigious universities and colleges in the West. In these academic worlds, syllabi are a materialization of labor and creativity: they represent a process of selecting and passing knowledge between people, many already failed by several barriers. However, in their uneven circulation and movement within, across, and at national, political, cultural, and geographic boundaries, syllabi engage a set of questions around the privileges associated with race, gender, class, access, and place. They constitute and are constituted by exclusions and inclusions to knowledge. Syllabi touch on language, education, epistemology, and colonialism, and they press on these textual legacies. Indeed, contemporary educational systems have long been and continue to be structured, articulated, packaged, transmitted, and exported in and by this form.</p>
			<p>On November 9, 2019 through February 8, 2020, we participated in the Rights of Future Generations, the inaugural event of the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, as part of the research collective, CCCP/2020, composed of students from the ’20 Critical, Curatorial and Conceptual Practices in Architecture program at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. Our project centered on syllabi. It was an installation that hoped to produce a portrait of the intellectual territories of the Triennial as refracted through the lens of the syllabus, in all its tensions.</p>

			<p>We saw the Triennial, and this structure writ large, as a critical node in the production of architectural knowledge: a networked collection point of intellectual exchange. In like manner, the syllabus exists as an agent of intellectual exchange, a powerful pedagogical tool that maps out certain terrains of research, articulates disciplinary foundations, makes theoretical and political claims, and aggregates texts and thinkers—all in order to select and pass knowledge from one person to another. Looking at these documents, we thought we might glimpse the larger intellectual choreographies at play in the Triennial and see where and how such systems of exchanging knowledge fit into and fall short of their aims.</p>
			<p>The installation, <i>Curricular Exchange</i>, aimed to specifically highlight questions of authorship and the syllabus as intellectual property within the larger context of contemporary property regimes and their relations. As intellectual property in our particular context, syllabi are not only held by an instructor, but also controlled by teaching contracts and institutional rights to creative work [intimately tied to questions of labor and its material reproduction for instance]. At the time, we wondered: “what alternatives exist between the ivory tower (the structures sheltering American higher education) and the Facebook group black market (the web pages created to share syllabi, readings, and material from those with an access to that educational structure)?” <i>Curricular Exchange</i> would be an experimental arena for the ‘free’ exchange of syllabi. While attempting to render public material often trapped behind institutional walls or pay walls, we recognized that sharing syllabi would not solve issues of access to education but rather pull at their seams.</p>
			<p><i>Curricular Exchange</i> distilled some of the spheres and pressures of and on the syllabus into carbon form, presenting a physical site for an exchange of syllabi collected from participants in advance of the Triennial opening and subsequently from visitors on site. Syllabi were exchanged through the form of a sibling transactional document: the paper receipt. By wearing this costume, a syllabus was ‘signed’ as proof of transacted value, and as a receipt became the site of intellectual exchange itself.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>This ‘curricular exchange’ was initiated by pressing a button located on a waist-high plinth, which printed a ‘customer’ syllabus-receipt, randomly selected from submitted entries, for your taking and a ‘merchant’ transactional log entry on another thermal printer. This space was accompanied by a wall on which printed syllabi on A4 paper hung by binder clips to allow us to add syllabi to the collection.</p>
			<p>Visitors were invited to print a syllabus, leave a syllabus, and consider the stakes as they made an exchange.</p>
			<p>After a difficult year, we have been sitting with some reflections on <i>Curricular Exchange</i> and our participation in the inaugural Triennial. In particular, we have been thinking about and with questions such as: what is the <i>currency</i> of the syllabus? As a receipt bearing witness to transacted <i>value</i>, what exactly is its value or what is valued? Of the submitted syllabi, what perspectives were covered? Who and what spoke/speaks? And in this speaking, who/whom/what/what else was made absent, missing, or inaccessible?</p>
			<p>The word “syllabus” comes from the Greek word “sittuba,” meaning slip and/or label. This ‘history’ (etymology or genealogy) contemplates ancient Greek vocabulary, its translation into Latin, “sittyba,” and its subsequent (mis)translation into modern Latin and its Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese vernaculars, including its uses in the Roman Catholic Church (i.g. The Syllabus of Errors, link), and into German, French, and English. These languages, not others (not Arabic, Chinese, or Hindustani, and certainly not Swahili, Quechua, Aymara, Nahuatl, or Cree) house the modern syllabus. This architecture engenders the analytical and narrative frameworks of modern education. These educational systems teach us, those who have access to an education or a particular education, how to think. Yet within this, there is assumption: that epistemology—as the theory or reflection of knowledge—and the syllabus—as a programme or abstract of knowledge—is not located or placed; rather, that it is universal and ungrounded, a neutral guardian of knowledge. Like the air we breathe, universal and ungrounded, does the weight of the syllabus slip under a threshold of decipherability? What would it mean to ground the syllabus in a politics of place?</p>

			</figure>
			<p>When we are forced to look carefully at these documents, they point to how language and education are tied to the coloniality of our modern world-system. The syllabus is part and parcel of an epistemological colonization of knowledge and memory. It is inseparable from the canonization, legitimization, continuation, and reproduction of Euro-American, white and male histories, archives, imaginations, and modes and minds of knowing. In other words, modern knowing and knowledge was founded or written on imperial and colonial difference. Language and knowledge of the ‘outside’ (or ‘other’) have certainly been translated and transformed into objects of study, but they are not taken as the loci of knowledge.</p>
			<p><i>Curricular Exchange</i> pressed on this (re)production of knowledge, and it played on capitalist modernity, how its promises and values are wedded to or impossible to divorce from (settler and neo-) colonialism, imperialism, racism, enslavement, genocide, and apartheid. As proof of value or perhaps even power, the syllabus-receipt bore witness to an agent, otherwise absent: currency, the typical representative of value in capitalist exchange. But in retrospect, our installation could never be a ‘free’ space of exchange. It was never a free or universal space in which anyone and everyone could join; rather, joining meant accepting the rules—the currency—of the game. And if you played the game, but not exactly according to the rules, it meant that you were on the ‘margins’ or on the ‘darker side’ of history. In other words, it made epistemic differences plainly visible and painfully real.</p>

			<p>Our installation and participation in the Triennial was perhaps always-already shadowed by a failure to perceive that colonial difference, a failure to account for the time, space, being, and power constituted by that difference. We came from ‘inside’ an elite academic institution in New York and arrived in Sharjah ‘inside’ the shadows of a Triennial. <i>Curricular Exchange</i> was like a microcosm of a larger architectural order, its sites of production, consumption, and exchange.  From the back anteroom or anterior space of the installation at the Triennial’s main venue, a decommissioned primary school built in the mid-1970s,<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> we could almost envision a world of relations, in miniature. This location, the Al-Qasimiyah School, kindled our longing to dream of alternative forms of knowledge production, and the Triennial’s theme asked and encouraged us to contemplate the “rights of future generations” in a place where climate change figures as both a threat to the future and a ghost from the past, swelling and surging with colonialist forms of violence and catastrophe. Yet, what appears to be the case on the surface is not always actually the case.</p>

			<p>Irony unfolded through language like “Sharjah Architecture Triennial is the first major platform for architecture and urbanism in the Middle East, North and East Africa, and South and Southeast Asia.” Nonetheless, it felt like those places and people  (i.e. the ‘Third World’ or ‘Global South’ to gesture to Latin America too) had little or nothing to say.  It felt like they were not invited (at least in the same capacity) to participate in a space in which they themselves seemed to be the objects of consideration. In this way, our participation (as conspirators from Columbia University) felt ironic, but this feeling we shared was something other or more than a comedic response. Maybe it was a distancing mechanism.</p>
			<p>There is a lot left to be said about contemporary biennials and triennials. We could write about pipelines, money, and elitism, or how they are used and abused by cities in an attempt to increase their value and cultural capital in an age of late capitalism. But this also seems to resist a feeling we have been avoiding: we have been building a defense that protects us from viewing our installation and participation from the ‘outside.’ To encounter this exteriority, is to unsettle and be unsettled.</p>
			<p>As a world in miniature, <i>Curricular Exchange</i> reflected a set totality, but it might also gesture to other possibilities. Inside the back anteroom of a decommissioned school, it waited for the emergence of a revolutionary situation, and we waited, inside, with it. This way of seeing is constitutive of a failure to perceive colonial difference in something as ‘small’ as the syllabus, but it ultimately amounts to a failure to perceive a Being written by that difference, what Walter Mignolo has called the “coloniality of being” and what many others call Blackness. By distancing and defense mechanisms, we avoid and deny the raciality and coloniality of those who have been dispossessed of their knowledge, land, and humanity. But to take seriously decolonization is to confront the outside and demand being in this outside. It is to possess an interior-exteriority, to be inside and at the same time outside. Perhaps the end of our installation asks us to do just that. It asks us to really confront architecture from the scale of the syllabi to the triennial and beyond; to contend with the banality (taken-for-grantedness) of the colonial practices ingrained in our educational systems; and to be uncomfortable and vulnerable in footing our place in the violence of them, how they are mobilized, deployed, and leveraged, and how they stake their claims to legitimacy, space, value, property, land, and authority over learning.</p>
